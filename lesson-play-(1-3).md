## First lesson
 ### Tools, Packages, Utilities and Reference Resources
  #### (Setting up your environment)

---
 ##### Interactive Development Environment (IDE)
  The IDE is where you will write your code. Through out these lessons we will use the VSCODE IDE. There are many others you can choose from, some specific to languages others general to coding. Often you will form a preference on the one you like the most, or be required to use a specific one while developing within a corporate environment.

  Let's Install VSCode now. Follow the instruction for the download and installation of VSCODE through their official website [VSCODE](https://)
 
 ##### Packages and Utilities 
  The packages and utilities you will use through out this course are only a fraction of available software pre-written to aid you in developing fast and more effecient applications. Through out this course we will use the NodeJS framework, and some of the packages with in its package manager for our design, theme controls, and layout. These packages include [ReactJS](), and [Material UI](). These packages are [HTML5]() and [JavaScript]() libraries that help reduce the amount of code we have to write.

  To install react and material ui we will use `npx` to setup our invironment in a consistant manner. Follow the tutorial here to get `NPX` installed with [NodeJS]() set to the latest long term supported version.

  We use the following packages, frameworks, and libraries to help us build our application. Check them out for further reference and to help answer questions you may have about them.

 ##### Reference Resources
  There are tons of resources available out today to help aide you on your journey to learning application development. Some of the resources we use are listed below in no perticular order.

  **Note** You may not be familar with some of these terms, it is best to do your research and get familar with the terms used in this document before continuing.

## Second lesson
 ### A basic web application
  #### (Using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript in the real world)

 We are going to learn how to create a very basic application that can be used to expand your ability to build web applications with time and practice.

 A basic Todo List application is one of the simplest application we can start to learn. Since one of the hardest parts of developing any application is organizing what you have to do to complete the final design this will also be a great tool we can use later when we want to build another application and need to organize what will need to be completed.

## Third lesson
 ### Learning to build beyond the box.
  #### (Practice make perfect. Learning is a life long journey.)

  Now that you have created a basic ToDo List application you are ready to start creating something of your own design. With the techniques you have already learned you are able to build what ever you can dream up and take the time to build. Sure you may need to look up references, syntax and solutions to the enevitable "how do i" question we as developers always face. However you should now have the foundation it take to begin building on your skills and learning a deeper understanding of the languages and tools used to build the ToDo List application. 

  In order to take your skills to the next level you can learn more about how data is transmitted over the internet and create the processes that allow you to use various Application Program Interface(API) and create dynamic customize applications that suite your needs.

  Some examples of using API's are pulling information from a resource to display the information in your application. Including images, text, and other data.

  In the Second lesson you utilized JavaScript CSS and HTML each of which have their own syntax and abilities. You may never know every command, but it's good practice to learn what each language has to offer and try various commands to get more familar with what you can do with them together.
